\subsection*{Turn-in instructions}
Create a new folder and add the following files to it:
\begin{itemize}
\item Edited project files from \productname, if any
\item A PDF file with the answers to each question \textit{clearly marked}. When you have completed this lab, you will have answered \total{questions} questions.
\item A \verb!who.txt! file with your name. If you worked with someone else, include their name in the \verb!who.txt! file.
\end{itemize}

Once your work is done and in the folder, zip the entire folder and submit it on ANGEL. You may work with a partner, as long as each of you submits your own copy of all of the listed files. Note that files submitted via email or other methods will receive zero credit. In addition, files that cannot be accessed without additional work (e.g. non-zip archives or LaTeX documents that require compiling) will lose you points. After you submit your files, please complete the feedback survey on Angel Under Labs - Labs Anonymous Feedback!
